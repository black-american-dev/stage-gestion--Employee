	this is the plan i will be doing in the stage :
first this app will be employee management for the company that have more department in :
	Laayoune, Smara, Dakhla, Boujdour
1) i will do a database contains the employee info ( full name, age, full work history, department he work in, contract type {director, employee, stagiaire ...}, CNSS, CIN, Salary)
and i will add this feature that will calculate his leave that he can request in a year and if he have just 5 days left he can't request 7 days (so don't waste time of HR )
	💡 Add rules
	     Max leave per year (ex: 18 days)
	     Cannot request leave if balance = 0
	     Auto-calculate remaining days
	     Prevent overlapping leave dates

	🧠 Example
	     Employee has 5 days left → system blocks request of 7 days


2) and i will add feature that he can generate pdf that always the same just small information change
he will have form so he add info just change hit generate button and the pdf will generate 

	💡Generate PDFs
	     Work certificate
	     Leave approval
	     Employee profile
	     Contract summary
	

3) and i will add to save time a search/filter function to search and filter employee :
	💡 Filters
	     By department
	     By contract type
	     By status
	     By leave balance
	     By hire date
